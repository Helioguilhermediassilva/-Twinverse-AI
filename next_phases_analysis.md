# Twinverse-AI: Next Phases Analysis

## Phase 2: Digital Avatar Generation

### Requirements
- Input: Visual description or selfie image
- Input: Visual style selection (realistic/cartoon/anime/futuristic)
- Process: Create animated avatar compatible with voice and emotion from music
- Process: Synchronize avatar with music for clip and film use
- Output: Avatar as video (.mp4) and 3D model (.glb or .fbx)

### Technical Considerations
- Integration with Ready Player Me API for base avatar creation
- Animation system for lip-syncing with music
- Emotion expression system based on music mood
- 3D model export capabilities
- WebGL integration for browser-based preview

### User Flow
1. User submits visual description or uploads selfie
2. User selects visual style preference
3. System generates avatar based on inputs and music emotion
4. System synchronizes avatar movements with music
5. User can preview and download avatar

## Phase 3: Short Film Creation

### Requirements
- Input: Music and avatar from previous phases
- Process: Generate 3-act screenplay (introduction, conflict, resolution)
- Process: Create automatic storyboard with key scenes
- Process: Produce short film using AI visual tools (Runway/Pika/Genmo)
- Output: Short film video (.mp4) with 2-5 minute duration

### Technical Considerations
- Integration with OpenAI for screenplay generation
- Integration with Runway ML Gen-2 or Pika Labs for video generation
- Storyboard generation system
- Video processing for combining avatar, music, and generated scenes
- Scene transition and editing capabilities

### User Flow
1. System analyzes music lyrics and emotion
2. System generates screenplay based on avatar and music
3. System creates storyboard for key scenes
4. System produces short film with avatar as protagonist
5. User can preview and download short film

## Phase 4: Publication Page

### Requirements
- Input: All assets from previous phases (music, avatar, short film)
- Process: Generate personalized page with all content
- Process: Create sharing capabilities
- Output: Public URL with interactive page

### Technical Considerations
- Responsive web design for all devices
- Media players for music and video content
- Avatar viewer with WebGL
- Social media integration for sharing
- URL generation system
- Hosting and deployment strategy

### User Flow
1. System compiles all generated assets
2. System creates personalized page with user's content
3. System generates public URL
4. User can access, view, and share their complete artistic experience
